        <li>The Maneki-neko (招き猫), literally meaning "beckoning cat," is a common Japanese figurine (lucky charm, talisman) which is often believed to bring good luck to the owner.</li>
        <li>The figurine depicts a cat (traditionally a calico Japanese Bobtail) beckoning with an upright paw, and is usually displayed in, and often at the entrance of, shops, restaurants, pachinko parlors, laundromats, dry cleaners, salons, and other businesses.</li>
        <li>Maneki-neko come in different colors, styles and degrees of ornateness. Common colors are white, black, gold and sometimes red. In addition to ceramic figurines, Maneki-neko can be found as keychains, piggy banks, air fresheners, house-plant pots, and miscellaneous ornaments, as well as large statues.</li>

        <li>Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage.</li>
        <li>Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pokémon mistook the intensity of its charge.</li>
